      <font size="2">I have been 
      aware of the amazing MAME emulator for many years now. But one day, out of 
      curious boredom, I discovered a few hobbyist websites dedicated to 
      detailing the progress and construction of a MAME arcade cabinet. Of note 
      were:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">“<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pharaohweb.com/pacman/pacman.html">The Pac-Man Cocktail Table Project</a>”<br>
      “<a target="_blank" href="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/whammoed/whammocade/whammocade.htm">Whammocade</a>”<br>
      “<a target="_blank" href="http://sparhawk.sbc.edu/MAME/">Aaron’s MAME’d Millipede Project</a>”</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Wow I was impressed. Yes it costs lots 
      of money, but it was too cool! Then I discovered the BYOAC (Build your own 
      Arcade Cabinet)
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arcadecontrols.org/yabbse/index.php">
      forums</a>&nbsp; 
      and became hooked. I would build my own arcade cabinet. “We have the 
      technology … we have the capability” … “make it so!”</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="2"><br>
      <br>
      <a name="Requirements">Requirements</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">What to do? What to do? There are so many 
      alternatives. What are my requirements? This is a fundamental question you 
      have to ask yourself. What will fulfill my desires?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I began to realize that I would like to own a cabinet 
      which was close to the same form as an original 80s classic. There is a 
      feeling of nostalgia associated with some of the old arcade classics, 
      notably Star-Castle, Space Invaders, Punch-Out, Track and Field and 
      Pac-Man, these being some of the arcade games of the 80s that I loved.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Next, I knew the wife wouldn’t exactly like the idea 
      of an arcade monstrosity sitting in the house. It would have to be 
      something which fits-in, and provides just a little bit of practicality.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">A cocktail style cabinet (the one which doubles as a 
      table, with players on each side) would be more suitable for me. I knew it 
      would limit me mostly to vertical oriented games, but I also knew I could 
      letterbox the small suite of horizontal games that I really had to have.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Although I didn’t formally compose a list of 
      requirements in the beginning, it’s safe to say they would have looked 
      something like this:</font></p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
        <li><font size="2">Cocktail style cabinet</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Be able to play most vertical games that MAME 
        emulates</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Approaching some authenticity to some original 80s 
        classic</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Try to keep it simple</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Avoid woodworking as much as possible</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I finally ended up choosing Pac-Man as a theme for 
      the cabinet. Pac-Man is a classic, and the availability of Pac-Man cabinet 
      kits and artwork was readily available from internet companies. I would go 
      with Pac-Man. It will be good.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <font size="2"><a name="Monitor">Monitor</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">My first investigation into building 
      cocktail cabinets landed me at Daves “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pharaohweb.com/pacman/pacman.html">The Pac-Man Cocktail Table Project</a>” 
      website. Since my project was going to share a lot of similarity, I culled 
      some vital information from his site. I highly recommend reading Dave’s 
      website, it contains a lot of useful information for cocktail cabinets. 
      Dave ended up selecting what is known as a ‘hybrid’ monitor, one which 
      could not only give you the lower frequency scan rates resembling the 
      cabinets of the 80s, but also could plug right into the VGA port of a PC 
      with no tricky connections. Now just to be clear, this monitor cannot run 
      at the true arcade refresh rates of 15.75KHz. This monitor's 
      specifications are 30 - 38KHz horizontal / 50 - 160 Hz vertical.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Running a PC monitor was a choice. But 
      I knew right off the bat, I wanted a larger degree of authenticity. I 
      wanted that lower resolution curved monitor like the originals had. I know 
      it’s a bit silly, but somehow I wanted that more antiquated feel. So I 
      decided I’d purchase the new lower resolution, curved ‘hybrid’ monitor. I 
      went ahead and ordered the monitor way ahead of time, from happcontrols. 
      It is a Vision Pro 19&quot; Horizontal Mount SVGA Monitor (model 49-1337-VP2).</font></p>

      <font size="2"><a name="PC hardware">PC hardware</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I started out with my old trusty 
      PII-450 computer. It was running an antiquated version of Redhat (7.1 to 
      be exact). I started to tinker with this and run games on it, but 
      eventually I decided I’d like to get a slightly beefier machine to run 
      some of the more recent ROMs.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I purchased a PIII-667 from a friend 
      for $125. I installed 192MB of RAM, and I migrated my Nvidia Geforce 4MX 
      card to it. The motherboard is the Asus P3C2000. I later purchased a 
      886Mhz Slot 1 SECC2 P-III processor and installed that to give me more 
      boost.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The computer case was pretty bulky. In 
      order to minimize the form-factor, I ended up with just the motherboard, 
      resting on a part of the frame, and only the back of the PC case to 
      support the cards. To do this, I had to drill out a bunch of rivets from 
      the PC case just to dismantle it.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Being a computer nerd, I figured I’d 
      start with the guts of the contraption (the PC) and work my way out. At 
      least I was pretty comfortable with this aspect of it. If I could just get 
      a PC going, a simple to use “black-box “which upon power-up would allow 
      the player to choose from a list of games, select the game, play and 
      provide an intuitive interface - that would be even more motivation to 
      push forward.</font></p>

      <font size="2"><a name="OS selection">OS selection</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The choice of OS brought to light 
      another condition:</font></p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
        <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Don’t use a Microsoft OS</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I admit there’s a “cool factor” for 
      running Linux. So I had to do it. Partly for the cool factor. Oh and also 
      because Microsoft would be too easy. Yes I realize that goes against one 
      of my requirements, but linux is also an environment which would afford me 
      the most tweaking and customizability (special tweaks to MAME itself 
      even). I have dabbled in linux for years so that would prove to be 
      helpful. So I first started to tinker with the Redhat 7.1 install I had 
      nurtured for at least 2 years. Hit several roadblocks getting various 
      software packages to compile/run properly. Finally concluded the OS was 
      just too old and didn’t have the necessary prerequisites for a lot of the 
      software I was compiling. Rifled through my linux distros and found some 
      unused Mandrake 9.1 install CDs. Dated much more recently than Redhat 7.1 
      so I installed it fresh on a different hard drive. This OS ended up being 
      my final choice. Note: I later discovered there exist custom linux distros 
      for the purpose of running Mame. Googling around for KnoppixMame or Gentoo 
      MAME is a good start.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
      <font size="2"><a name="MAME variant">MAME variant</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">In the world of linux you have many 
      choices. For one, there are different graphics libraries you can utilize 
      to run MAME. You can run in X, in the SDL graphics library, in the svgalib 
      library, in frame-buffer and probably several others. </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">There are also different variations of 
      the MAME emulator itself. There is the vanilla xmame source tree, and 
      other more specific variations of MAME. </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Xmame.svgalib runs from the linux 
      console. You do not need to have the X Windowing environment up and 
      running. It is purported to be one of the fastest graphics libraries 
      available for linux. AdvanceMame also runs from the console and is a 
      specialized version of Mame designed to run at special frequency scan 
      rates, and it is also suggested it utilize the svgalib library.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">It came down to whether I wanted to 
      run an arcade monitor true to the original monitor frequency scan rate 
      specifications that the game wants. Running games this way (using 
      AdvanceMame) would provide the closest experience to the actual arcade 
      game, as the game and monitor scan rates would be working at the same 
      frequencies as the original hardware of the original arcade game. </font>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The downside of this approach (as I 
      found out) is the complexity involved in the technical configuration of 
      monitor scan lines for your video card and monitor. Aaron’s Millipede Mame 
      conversion project was able to get it to work successfully, but I 
      encountered problems. I tinkered with AdvanceMame and its supporting 
      configuration utilities with my hardware. I encountered issues, some I 
      believe rooted in the fact that I’m using an NVidia chipset. Aside from 
      the specialized frequency scan rates which AdvanceMame supports, it does 
      offer other small improvements above what MAME offers. </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">But due to my issues with my video 
      card, and my configuration frustrations I eventually abandoned this 
      approach. I can live with not running MAME at the perfect frequency scan 
      rates. The only disadvantage is what is known as “tearing”. This is most 
      apparent in scroller games (Xevious for example) where you’ll notice 
      graphic anomalies which ripple up the screen every few seconds. It doesn’t 
      ruin the experience, but certainly isn’t ideal.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The standard xmame codebase allows you 
      to compile MAME for several graphics libraries. Svgalib ended up being the 
      best and most capable graphics library for me. I downloaded and installed 
      the library itself. Then downloaded and compiled Xmame for this library. I 
      immediately hit roadblocks with “svgalib_helper”. After more research I 
      determined that I needed to insmod the svgalib_helper.o file into the 
      kernel on startup. After this, my initial tests of xmame.svgalib were very 
      positive. Pac-Man came up, full screen in the linux console. Sound worked 
      well also (with the installed Sound Blaster 128 PCI card). My final choice 
      was xmame.svgalib (based on MAME version 1.86)</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">After my failed attempts to get 
      AdvanceMame working properly, I noticed the same author created a 
      Front-end called 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/menu-readme.html">AdvanceMenu</a>. It is a very mature and flexible front-end. 
      It allows favorites, sort options, screen snapshot screensavers, 
      background music, sound effects and a lot more. I couldn’t get it to jive 
      well with svgalib with my hardware, so I compiled it against SDL and it 
      worked pretty darn well. This ended up being the front-end of choice. </font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I do remember spending a&nbsp;good 
      deal of time removing all the unused roms from the AdvanceMenu .advance/xmame.svgalib.xml 
      file. This file is used by AdvanceMenu to obtain all the specific rom 
      attributes. Removing the roms allowed AdvanceMenu to startup faster. I 
      ended up writing a small C program which given the name of a rom, would 
      search the xmame.svgalib.xml file and pull out the content just for that 
      rom. Then I wrote a bash script which simply looped through all my roms in 
      /usr/local/share/xmame/roms and pulled out all the rom data into a new xml 
      file. All this to get the frontend to startup faster :)</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;I did end 
      up modifying the color scheme to my liking (the ugly white default 
      background was not good). I went ahead and inserted all of the game screen 
      snaps, so the frontend would not only display the games snapshot in the 
      menu, but also enter a ‘screensaver’ mode displaying these images at 
      random. Also I configured a “Favorites” group for my favorite games to go. 
      I did some additional key remapping to allow me to overload a lot of my 
      button inputs to fire events in the frontend itself. See the I-PAC section 
      for a little more detail.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

      <font size="2"><a name="I-PAC">I-PAC</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Dave’s website refered to the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ultimarc.com/ipac1.html">I-PAC</a> peripheral, which is designed 
      specifically for intercepting control panel signals and translating them 
      to keyboard presses. This was the obvious choice for me. I knew I would 
      have 2 fairly simple panels on each side of the cabinet. I would have a 
      maximum of 3 ‘fire’ buttons for each player, and 2 joysticks (1 4-way, 1 
      8-way) wired together in parallel, sharing the same circuit. For this 
      setup, I would need the basic offering: the I-PAC 2. They’re shipped from Ultimarc and are neat little inventions. They allow key customizations, 
      and also remember your settings in EEPROM. It also comes with specialized 
      software which makes it easy to program. Highly recommended, and obviously 
      a fundamental part of the system.</font></p>

      <font size="2"><a name="I-PAC config">I-PAC config</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Well it’s not extremely complicated 
      really. I wanted a few customizations done. I wanted it so that I could 
      use the Shift-key feature of the I-PAC to allow certain key presses to 
      allow me to do things, like pause the game, enter the Mame menu, sort the 
      game list in the frontend, add to favorites etc. I used a spreadsheet to 
      map out what I wanted the inputs to be. For example, holding down 1-player 
      start and Fire1 will insert a coin. Holding down 1-player start and Fire3 
      will pause the MAME emulation. This effort was made especially easier by 
      the fact that the AdvanceMenu configuration allows any keyboard input to 
      control any feature of the frontend. I was able to modify the default 
      AdvanceMenu key of F12 which normally pulls up the selection to run a 
      clone, to switch it so if you pressed space bar, the frontend would 
      perform this action. This way, MAME Fire button 3 (normally the space bar) 
      is overloaded to mean one thing in MAME and another in AdvanceMenu. This 
      is just one example.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">What else did I need? Well I went 
      through the effort of acquiring nearly every vertical ROM, in addition to 
      screen snaps of every game. I loaded all of these roms until I had 
      AdvanceMenu coming up nicely. </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The next step was to configure linux 
      so that it would enter the menu upon startup. This was a matter of using 
      the --autologin feature of rungetty. I downloaded rungetty and installed it, 
      and after an hour or so, I had the machine logging in as user “mame” and 
      automatically invoking Advancemenu.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Next was the ability to allow the 
      player to exit the menu and halt the machine. I first gave permissions for 
      the ‘mame’ user to invoke ‘halt’. Then I wrote a simple prompt program 
      which runs after the frontend exits. It asks whether you want to shutdown 
      or re-enter the menu. I figured pressing the 1-player button would halt, 
      2-player would re-enter the menu. Also wrote it to timeout waiting for 
      user input and re-enter the menu. I hooked this simple program into my .bash_profile, 
      calling the frontend also in a loop and I was done. Source is provided <u>
      <a href="files/uinput.c.txt">here</a></u>. Yes, the text appears sideways when you’re playing the cabinet 
      (since the monitor is oriented vertically). No biggie.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Also found a nice piece of Mame <u>
      artwork</u> to display as my linux boot splashscreen. Took a little of 
      tinkering to get it to display properly.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">MAME hiscores are supported via the 
      hiscore.dat file you can find at
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mame.net">www.mame.net</a>. I also had to make sure the 'nvram' directory was 
      present to allow for other high-score saving functionality. This is a 
      directory in which MAME writes the information which the game keeps in 
      memory. This is required for some games.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Now that linux is all configured, it’s 
      a relief. But I will say, there were frustrations along the way. I 
      experienced nagging technical issues a lot. Like the auto-login feature; 
      it seems to take 8 seconds for the box to actually auto-login. Never 
      figured out why. I had some temporary sound issues. Also fussed with the 
      svgalib configuration file for an hour or two.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Along the way, I “ghosted” the drive

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Well I’m honestly not an accomplished 
      carpenter. And I hardly own any woodworking tools. Dave’s website had 
      information about arcadedepot.com. They offered cocktail cabinet kits 
      (assembled or unassembled), prestained, pre-t-molding and everything. It 
      was the obvious choice for me to go ahead and purchase an unassembled 
      cabinet kit from arcadedepot. They offered a Pac-Man style cocktail 
      cabinet (Oak wood, Colonial Maple stain), with 11” control panels so I went with that. I also ordered the 
      tempered glass top.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="images/IMG_4559.jpg" target="_top">
      <img border="2" src="images/IMG_4559_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/IMG_4559.jpg" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Upon receiving the package in the 
      mail, I laid out all the pieces. It came with instructions. The 
      construction involved mostly securing the pieces with wood glue and 
      dowels. After a few days I had the bottom and 4-sides assembled. Next came 
      the control panel bays. This was fairly straightforward. The next step was 
      the attachment of the hinged-side via the piano-style hinge hardware. This 
      was a pain to get to line up exactly, but eventually I managed to get it 
      attached almost perfectly. The next step was the attachment of the cabinet 
      top to the hinged-side. I spent probably 45 minutes making sure the top 
      was exactly centered on the top of the cabinet. Finally I managed to 
      attach the top carefully making sure I didn’t accidentally hit it with my 
      elbow or something and have it be misaligned. In hindsight it would have 
      helped a lot to have a clamp device to secure things. </font></p>

      <img border="2" src="images/IMG_4610s_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/IMG_4610s.jpg" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Now that the basic structure of the 
      cabinet was done, I had to decide where to cut out the holes for the 
      intake fan, exhaust fan and speakers. I decided the exhaust fan would go 
      on the bottom of the hinged-side of the cabinet. The intake fan would go 
      on the bottom of the 2-player side. I then used a jigsaw to cut out the 
      holes.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">For the speaker holes, I decided I’d 
      pretty much do the basic thing. Put one small speaker on each player side 
      of the cabinet under your knees. Fairly straightforward, so I purchased a 
      large 3” circular drill-bit to cut these holes out, based upon the cheap 
      PC speaker system I had purchased.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="images/IMG_4665s.jpg" target="_top">
      <img border="2" src="images/IMG_4665s_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/IMG_4665s.jpg" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Next came the control panels. After 
      experimenting with how the panels would attach to the panel bays, I really 
      wasn’t satisfied with how they sat. The little wooden stabilizers which 
      came with the kit, designed to fit on each side of the inside of the 
      panel, ended up not raising the panel high enough. If I peered at the 
      bottom of the panel, the panel bottom (where the little lip is with 3 
      screw holes) didn’t reach the bottom of the panel bay area. There was a 
      gap there.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I decided I’d use some wood, and cut 
      out my own custom panel stabilizers.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I used pieces of cardboard as guides, 
      and after a few tries, I had the appropriate control panel stabilizer 
      template. I then carefully cut some pieces out of some poplar wood. The 
      first dry-run installation ended up being very successful. The panels are 
      secure, and sit up plenty high for the bottom of the joysticks to not rub 
      against the bay bottom, and also the panel lines up perfectly with the 
      very bottom-side of the bays. I painted the edges black because I 
      discovered the wood shows through in the crevice a bit where the side of 
      the panel meets with the bay. The picture below shows the joysticks 
      assembled incorrectly which I fixed later.</font></p>

      <font size="2"><a name="Volume Control">Volume Control</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I toiled back and forth deciding 
      whether I would need an external volume control mounted on the cabinet. I 
      pondered ways in which I could adjust volume via software. Eventually I 
      concluded an externally mounted volume knob was necessary, given the quiet 
      sanctitude of my house late at night, and the ease for which my wife could 
      just turn the knob.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I used the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oscarcontrols.com/volume/index.shtml">
      Oscar controls</a> website as a reference. I drove to 
      Radio Shack and luckily found the stereo potentiometer I needed. It was 
      the &quot;Stereo Volume Control, 100K dual-ganged with audio taper&quot;. I also 
      purchased a few small-size plastic volume knobs to attach to it.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">After I had this, I then contemplated 
      how I would mount it. The rod on the control wasn’t long enough to fit all 
      the way through the thickness of the cabinet. I tried to do what the site 
      indicated, using an extension and a shaft-collar to extend the thing so 
      the actual rod would poke out of the cabinet far enough to comfortably 
      attach a plastic knob. Ultimately however, I decided what I would do is 
      drill a hole for the potentiometer rod, then I would drill out a larger 
      hole on the outside just a few centimeters deep to accommodate a small 
      knob, which would then sit inside the wood a bit.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I fashioned a little bracket to secure 
      the potentiometer on the inside of the cabinet. It is just a simple 
      L-shaped bracket, and I drilled out a larger hole in it to accommodate the 
      potentiometer. Things were looking hopeful.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="images/IMG_4662.sm.jpg" target="_top">
      <img border="2" src="images/IMG_4662.sm_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/IMG_4662.sm.jpg" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I managed to salvage some old Y-cord 
      headphone wires for the wiring. I figured out how to connect the wires to 
      the potentiometer and control the volume based on the Oscar controls site.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I figured I would create a wire which 
      would plug into the PC sound card output, extend to the volume control, 
      and at the other side have a female plug for the speaker system to plug 
      in. So this volume control would sit right between the PC sound card and 
      the speaker system. I found some Y-cord headphone wiring with a male and 
      female end in my house. I cut up the wire, and after some crude soldering, 
      I managed to get the individual connections soldered to the potentiometers 
      fairly small connection nodes to some degree of satisfaction. See the 
      Oscar Controls 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oscarcontrols.com/volume/index.shtml">site</a> for more details. As long as I didn’t tug on the thing 
      hard, it should hold. </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I mounted the thing to the inside 
      hinged-door side of the cabinet near the bottom, using the metal bracket I 
      fashioned. The potentiometer rod ended up sticking out a little on the 
      outside of the cab. The larger drilled out hole on the outside allowed me 
      to embed a small volume knob just below the outside surface and secure the 
      knob to the potentiometer rod with a small screwdriver.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">With this in place, all I would do 
      then is just plug in the male plug into the PC sound card, and plug in the 
      speaker system into the female side with the volume control in the middle.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I ordered 2 11” metal control panels 
      from arcadedepot. Dave had setup one 4-way and one 8-way joystick so I did 
      that also. I decided on 3 main ‘fire’ buttons for each player. I’m aware 
      of the switchable 4-way to 8-way joysticks where you pull upwards on the 
      stick and twist it to alter the configuration. At the time though, I had 
      decided on 2 joysticks mainly due to my inexperience, and had read that 
      some games play funny with 8-ways. I have yet to really find a game, other 
      than Q-bert which really needs the 4-way. Well that’s the choice I made at 
      the time. I went with the Happ Controls 8-way Competition Joystick and the 
      Ultimate Joystick 4-way from Happs.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I designed the control layout and 
      emailed it to arcadedepot. For a nominal charge, they will cut out the

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The panels are pretty straightforward. 
      Each side has one 4-way stick, one 8-way stick and 3 fire buttons. The 
      player 1 side has a player-1 start and player-2 start button. I went ahead 
      and purchased the black carriage bolts (10-24 X 1-1/2 CARRIAGE BOLT BLACK 
      OXIDE) from HappControls for the joysticks to make it look nice.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Not a lot to say here. I purchased 
      22-gauge wire, some female disconnects and a stripper and crimper. Each 
      switch is comprised of a ground and the main. The I-PAC has 2 main ground 
      connections, and of course a wiring node for each control. It was just an 
      exercise in patience, cutting the wire, stripping it, and crimping the 
      disconnects to the wire. The switches have these little metal spades that 
      the female disconnects will sort of slide onto with some force. The I-PAC 
      has small screw-down type connectors. I just made sure my wires were long 
      enough and labeled each wire with a little sticker to indicate which 
      control this wire was for. This labeling is essential in my case since I 
      only had two wire colors to use (red and yellow).</font></p>

      www.bitsltd.com</a>. I ordered the same thing. This way, the main computer 
      being off/on would signal to the monitor and speakers to also power 
      off/on.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The great thing about my motherboard 
      BIOS is that it supports the ability to power-up if you smack the space 
      bar (or another other select keyboard presses that you can choose from). 
      Since the Fire 3 button would be wired to the space bar, I decided I’d 
      make that button be my Power-up button. This way, I would not have to 
      install any special switch on the bottom of the cabinet or anything.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The only downside to this 
      configuration is that if I lose power and get power back again, the PC

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">To install the power strip, I drilled 
      a hole in the back of the cabinet near the bottom. I took apart the power 
      strip, and cut the main power cord from the strip. This allowed me to 
      route the power cord through the little hole. I then wired the cord back 
      to the power strip and sealed it back up. So now, the main power cord was 
      sticking out of a small hole on the back.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Originally I had determined I wouldn’t

      or something. But fairly late into the process, I realized something. I 
      had purchased little latches from arcadeshop.com which mount on the inside 
      top of the cabinet. These are used to latch the top of the cabinet to the 
      sides of the cabinet, so that it’s secure and doesn’t budge. Well how 
      useful are the latches if you cant reach into the cabinet and secure the 
      latches?</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I checked out the brand new doors 
      which Happs offered. Nice, little pricey. I then wondered onto ebay. They 
      had auctions for 2 excellent quality 2-player coin doors, originally 
      manufactured in 1983. The pictures looked excellent. I had to have one so 
      I bid high. I ended up paying around $50 for it. When it arrived, I 
      cleaned it up a bit, and checked it over. Other than a minor piece of 
      broken plastic on the inside, it was in excellent condition for such an 
      old coin door. The keys to the door were put on my keychain =)</font></p>

      to a 12v from my PC power supply. The lamps burned for over an hour before 
      finally each one burned out. Well it was no big deal, I wanted to replace

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The power strip was mounted vertically

      <font size="2"><a name="Monitor mounting">Monitor mounting</a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">This was a pain really. It was one of 
      the last major things I had to do. This monitor was heavy so I knew it has 
      to be secured super securely, and it had to be centered precisely being 
      the perfectionist that I try to be.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I opened the hinged side door and let 
      it rest on an old plant pot, parallel to the floor. I placed the monitor 
      in position and figured out how high it would need to be elevated from the 
      hinged side door to align in the center of the arcade top window. As it 
      turned out, it was pretty much exactly 2 3/4&quot; poplar boards stacked high in 
      height.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="images/IMG_4738s.jpg" target="_top">
      <img border="2" src="images/IMG_4738s_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/IMG_4738s.jpg" width="100" height="75"></a><a href="images/IMG_4735s.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/IMG_4735s_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/IMG_4735s.jpg" width="100" height="75"></a></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">So I cut out some poplar, and then 
      went to Lowe's and purchased some heavy duty wood screws. I then secured 
      the 2-stacked wood pieces (I’ll refer to them as shims from now on) to the 
      hinged door side of the cabinet. I made sure the wood screws were long 
      enough and thick enough for the load they would have to take.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I then placed the monitor on top of 
      these wood shims and it aligned well. I went ahead and secured the monitor 
      to the wood shims with other bolts I had purchased, measuring things 
      carefully to make sure the monitor was aligned on all angles. Once it was 
      secured very well, I was able to lift the hinged door into place, with the 
      monitor also in place. It wasn’t bolted to the arcade top yet but still it 
      was very secure. Use of a ratchet to screw-in the bolts was essential 
      here.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Next was the step of cutting out some 
      wood shims which would attach the monitor to the arcade top. I measured it 
      and it came out to 2” between the monitor and top. So I cut out some long 
      2” wood shims, and pre-drilled holes so I could first attach the shims to 
      the arcade top. At a few places, when I screwed the shims to the top, I 
      heard some splintering sounds. It turned out that the screw was separating 
      the two pieces of the arcade top as it entered halfway through the arcade 
      top (the arcade top is actually made of two flat pieces glued/screwed 
      together). Just a couple of screws caused this issue, most didn’t. I 
      didn’t take my chances in damaging the arcade top. I went ahead and 
      screwed the wood shims to the arcade top as good as possible, without 
      compromising the arcade top itself.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">With the 2 top wood shims in place, I 
      used bolts to secure the monitor to the shims. I was careful throughout 
      the process to ensure the arcade top was at a 90 degree angle to the 
      hinged side.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The wood shims are a bit bulky, but I 
      felt it was important to have some heavy-duty shims in place, to handle 
      the weight of the monitor.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Opening the cabinet, taking care not 
      to just fling it open and damage something takes some strength. As you 
      open the top, you gotta support the weight of the monitor as the cabinet 
      unfolds. Carefully lifting the top back into place is also a muscle 
      workout.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I needed a small form-factor, simple 
      speaker system with a subwoofer. I purchased a $30 el-cheapo Creative Labs 
      SBS350 system 
      from CompUSA. I ended up removing the speakers from their plastic shells 
      by brute force. This allowed me to mount the speakers themselves directly 
      to the inside of the cabinet with 4 screws.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">For the speaker covers, I ordered two 
      6x9 Speaker Covers (used for Midway games) from Arcadeshop. </font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I also ordered the 19” pre-cut monitor 
      bezel from arcadedepot. In the end when I put it into place, I realized 
      there was a very small gap on each end of the monitor. It wasn’t exactly 
      flush. I ended up just sticking a thin strip of the fuzzy side of Velcro 
      on each end of the bezel. This made it seemless.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I ordered the leg 
      levelers from Happscontrols. These little feet allow you to raise the cabinet off the 
      ground a bit, which is true to the original cabinet design.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="images/IMG_4717.jpg" target="_top">

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I ordered the 8-pack of black anodized 
      cocktail glass clips from arcadedepot also. In the end, when I placed the 
      glass top down and used the clips to try to secure the glass, the clips 
      just didn’t reach the glass sufficiently. The T-molding, or the arcade top 
      was just a little too big. I struggled with what I was going to do to 
      resolve this. The glass top had to be secured well, especially when 
      opening the cabinet top.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I finally realized that if I could 
      bend the clips 15 degrees or so, it just might be enough to allow the 
      clips to reach over and secure the glass well. The clips shipped at a 90 
      degree angle. I used some electrical tape so as to not scratch up the 
      clips as I bent them. This ended up being the perfect solution to the 
      problem. The clips reach over well, and provide sufficient downward 
      pressure to clamp down the glass top quite well. Oh yeah, make sure you 
      Windex the monitor and underside of the glass top very well before 
      securing it down.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I wanted the power cord sticking out 
      of the back of the cabinet to look a bit more professional. So I decided 
      I’d purchase a little rubber grommet to fit around the cord where it comes 
      out of the cabinet. Well, the wood is pretty thick, and I couldn’t easily 
      find a grommet which would work well for me.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">So I ended up taking a short cut. I 
      purchased a little white plastic rectangular face plate from Lowes. It was 
      intended for some internal-wall electrical hardware or something. I 
      drilled out a hole in that and put a little rubber grommet in that (which 
      fit just fine). Then I inserted the power cord through this, and mounted 
      the face plate to the outside of the cabinet. It looks more professional; 
      it’s not perfect, but better than just a hole in the wood. It was a little 
      thing which really isn’t that important.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">note: I ended up actually
      disassembling the Smart Strip, in order to cut the main AC wires from
      where it is soldered inside. This way, I could take off the AC cord by
      itself and insert it through the little hole I drilled in the cabinet.
      Once through the hole in the wood, I then had to rewire the AC power cord
      to the inside of the Smart Strip and reassemble it. This saved me from
      having to drill out a larger hole in the wood.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">A couple of days after I had completed 
      the project, I was making some waffles with the batter in a vessel, mixing 
      it up. I walked over to the cabinet just to admire it, when I accidentally 
      slipped, and the batter splattered onto the 1-player side of the cabinet, 
      getting all over the control panel. It’s not cool when your cabinet smells 
      like waffle batter for 2 days.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">When I ordered the black carriage 
      bolts from Happs, I didn’t order enough so I had to spend extra shipping 
      money to get the remaining ones. This actually happened twice!</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">When I ordered another small two parts 
      from Happs, I had specified on the web site to ship all items even if some 
      were not in stock. This ended up hitting me more on shipping costs. One 
      shipment was just a few measly carriage bolt screws!</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I really should have purchased large 
      clamps during the cabinet construction phase. This would have made the 
      cabinet a bit more precisely constructed. This also would have helped 
      during the monitor mounting phase.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">When I was lifting out the Velcro-ed 
      subwoofer one day, it slipped and it ended up slamming into the bottom of 
      the volume potentiometer breaking off the connection nodes on the 
      underside. These nodes were thankfully not vital to the operation of the 
      potentiometer, but it was a close call.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I had installed the joysticks 
      improperly at first, putting the little round plastic cylindrical shaped 
      thingy at the bottom of the mechanism instead of above the stick itself. I 
      ended up having to remove each control panel and re-install the joysticks, 
      and it’s a pain removing those little e-clips from the bottom of the 
      joysticks.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">When I installed the cabinet-top 
      latches, I installed them before I had installed the monitor itself. After 
      the monitor went in, I realized the latches were hitting up against the 
      monitor as you latched/unlatched the thing. So I had to reposition the 
      latches about ¾ of an inch. Even after this however, the monitor was still 
      sort of getting in the way of the latches movement, so I ended up bending 
      the metal on the latches so that the latches stick out less when you 
      unlatch/latch the mechanism.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">When I was fooling around with the 
      black anodized cocktail glass clips, I had screwed them with these fairly 
      small screws. Upon removing some of the screws, a couple of the screws 
      themselves broke leaving half the screw in the wood. This isn’t my fault 
      really, but frustrating.</font></p>
